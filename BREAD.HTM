<h3>BAUIRSAK</h3>
The name bauyrsak can also mean ‘‘try instead of salt.’’ Ultimately it carries the idea that eating the bread together brings closeness.In the nomadic days of the Kazakh people only the most wealthy could afford to buy sacks of flour. Flour product at that time were very rare. The nomadic lifestyle prevented the preparation of sour dough, and far between. This led to using the available fiour to cook products such as bauyrsak.                                                                                                                    Bauyrsak is a ceremonial dish. At any wedding, party, funeral, or memorial service Kazakhs will serve bauyrsak along with sour cream and strong tea with cream. Also on the dastarkhan will be kurt-irimshik, various sweets, and heaps of golden bauyrsak. Its abundance is a sign of the generosity of the host.                                                                               Traditionally there are two different types of sour dough bauyrsak. For high quality preparation, thick-walled cauldron is used. The smooth surface of the cooking board is sprinkled with flour and the dough is rolled into a sausage shaped roll, then cut into pieces. The bauyrsak pieces are then fried in vegetable oil until they become round and plump. When they turn golden brown they are removed and placed on a piece of fabric to cool. The second type bauyrsak is preparated by rolling the dough until it is half a centimeter thick. This is cut into diamond shaped pieces. Each piece has two or three small incisions cut into it, which causes the dough to swell when it is fried. In various regions this type of bayursak is called by different names-cut bauyrsak, flat bauyrsak, or ‘‘scraps’’.                                              Also bauyrsak can be prepared from unleavened dough. Butter is usually added to the dough, though this can be replaced with mayonnaise. A little baking soda is added to make the pastries light. The dough is rolled into sausages or flat like a pancake and then cut. Afterbeing fried, this type of bauyrsak does not deteriorate or grow stale. This feature of unleavened dough is central to the preparation of chiy-bauyrsak. Here the dough is rolled into the shape of a sausage, no thicker than a woman’s little finger, and then cut into small pieces. It is called chiy-bauyrsak because it is put on a specially woven small reed mat. Chiy-bauyrsak is given to travelers as they set off on a long journey and is good for including in parcels sent to relatives living far away. When it becomes dry it does not lose its nutritional value and the texture remains light. When crushed in a mortar, chiy-baursak is a key ingredient in a food called zhent.                                                                                                             In addition to the two types mentioned above, there is a third type that is prepared for honored guests. It is made from white unleavened dough with white flour, milk, and butter. The dough is rolled into long, thin sausages and folded into several small rings or cut into long sticks. A rolling pin is used to roll the dough thin and the dough is folded four times and cut into a narrow ribbon using a curved knife a serrated edge. The cut strips of dough are then worked into even rings. The rings are fried in boiling oil, removed with a skimmer, and set out to dry. While still hot, they are sprinkled with powdered sugar or boiling honey. In Kazakh this type of bauyrsak is called shiyrtpak (‘‘spirals’’) or burama bauyrsak (‘‘folds’’).                                                                                                                                               For all bread products, the dough is kneaded using either salt water or whole milk diluted with water. Should the need arise to add oil or other ingredient to the dough, they should be dissolver in water or injected into the batch dough. Eggs should be broken into a separate bowl before being added to the dough and then stirred or whisked in.

<H3>Tandor Nan   </H3>
This bread is baked in a dome shaped brick oven that has a wide base and narrow hole at the top. Cakes of leavened or unleavened dough cling directly to the hot bricks inside the heated oven until they are ready. This bread is widely distributed in Central Asia, especially in the southern regions of Kazakhstan. In cities such as Almaty, Shymkent and Taraz there are huge, gas-heated ovens that produce large quantities of hot bread for sale to the public. Light, lush, soft, sour dough tandoor nan has an excellent taste.

<h3>SAMSA</h3>
In the old days, samsa was stuffed with meay that had been pre-fried. Today, it is common to add boiled rice and potatoes to the meat.                                                              Sour dough or unleavened dough may be used for samsa .It is cut into pieces that are molded into balls, placed in rows, and sprinkled with flour. The entire batch is covered with a towel and left to sit for 10-15 minutes. After the dough rises,it is rolled out like shelpek to a thickness of  1.5 centimeters. Meat filling is placed on each shelpek and salted to taste. The edges are folded together, and ruffles are created along the edges. The closed samsa, placed on an oiled baking sheet, bakes in an oiled baking sheet, bakes in an oven for 10-15 minutes, until its color turns golden. Then it is covered with butter and allowed to sit and cool. Samsa can also be prepared in a pot,cooked in oil.

<H3>KARYMA </H3>
As nomads, the Kazakhs did not always have access to ovens for baking bread, so they used a taba  - a double frying pan. From this ancient method of baking bread comes the term karyma-nan , from the root word kary(‘‘roasting’’). When a cauldron is used instead, the bread is called kazanzhappa. To prepare this type of bread, the dough must be kneaded and then yeast, milk, salt, waterm and butter are added. After the dough rises, it is formed into a thin cake, no thicker than one centimeter deep, with uniformly rolled edges. The bottom of the pan is covered with oil. The bread is carefully laid into the hot pan. Sometimes the baker will form different designs or patterns in top of the bread, using her fingers, a fork, or a spoon. Then a lid is placed tightly on the pan. The bread then needs to slow-cook over a fire or hot coals. On a double pan coals can be placed on top, or a frying pan can be turned upside down to cook the top of the bread. Bread cooked in a cauldron should be flipped over with a spatula in order for both sides to cook. While baking, the bottom of the bread should stay above the hollow dome of the cauldron, not touching the bottom. For this reason it is important that the edges of the bread are smooth and even-so that the distribution of heat remains even in the bottom of the cauldron. If a cast iron cauldron has a sealable lid then it too can be flipped over halfway through the cooking process.                                                           Karyma or batter nan is served to honored guests, torn or cut into pieces and served with sour cream or butter.

<h3>SHELPEK</h3>
This thin pastille is also the ceremonial dish. It is made of fermented or unleavened dough, which is rolled as thin and fried with oil, which should be in abundance for smooth cooking.  Shelpeks and baursaks are known for along time and is a characteristic accessories of   kazakh dastarcan. They are served in hot and should be tasted the first during funeral repast. In saint Friday ‘‘seven shelpeks’’ must be cooked and prays are read. One kind of shelpek is mai  shelpek whish is kneaded on butter with some salt water. Mai shelpek is tasty when it is poured with fruit juice before serving. It is called ‘‘salde.’’ Su shelpek is cooked in salt water and served with kuyrdak.  
<H3>Batter Nan </H3>                                                                                                                      
As with karyma nan, this bread is prepared by forming it to the size of a frying pan and laying it on the bottom. The dough must be rolled out thinly so that the bread cooks thoroughly. Also, to ensure that the batter is not burned and cooks evenly, small hollows are made on the surface of the bread with fingers or the end of a spoon, and a lid is placed on the frying pan. The double pan is buried in hot ashes to ensure even cooking from the top and bottom. If the ashes cool prematurely the batter will come out half-baked, so it is important to maintain a constant temperature.                                                                                                                                Batter can also be prepared from unleavened dough. When the dough is browned it can be turned with a spatula. Both batter and karyma should be served hot with butter.                                                                                                                             All of these bread product are both delicious and nutritious.                                                   
<H3>Kulshe    </H3>                                                                                                                              
This round loaf is flattened in the middle and bears a resemblance to kurt, from which it borrows its name. Like kurt, it is made from molded, small, unleavened dough and cooked in ashes, resulting in a fairy thick, flat bread. In some places it is called kombe i.e. treasure (buried). When the bread is ready, the baker blows on it and wipes it with a special cloth. No trace of ash remains on the kulshe. This is the most ancient method of baking for the nomadic Kazakh people and it was very conducive to their lifestyle, allowing them to feed the children while preparing other food.                                                                                                                       
<H3>Tokash   </H3>                                                                                                                               
Add to warm water a little salt and sugar. Pour in some white flour and knead the dough. Add melted butter, margarine, or vegetable oil and knead the dough again. From unleavened dough a type of tokash called shiyrtpak (meaning ‘‘spirals’’) is prepared. As with bauyrsak, it is made by preparing long, sausage shaped rolls. This is doubled over and twisted. Then the two ends are joined, forming a circle. After being coated with egg white and yolk, the circles are placed on a greased baking sheet and cooked in a preheated oven. Depending on the thickness of the dough, the tokash cooks for 15-20 minutes. The twisty tokash crisps can be stored for a long time. It is also possible to fry shiyrtpak in the same way bauyrsak is fried; however , when frying,egg should not be used.                                            Sour dough for tokash is kneaded in water without milk and butter. When the dough has risen sufficiently, it is rolled out, covered with flour, closed up tightly and put in a warm place. After the dough has risen again,it is pressed down two to three times and sprinkled with flour. When the dough will not stick to the hands and utensils, this means that the dough is ready. It is then cut into pieces and molded into balls the size of a fist. The balls are placed on a well-greased pan, not touching one another, and put into the oven. While cooking, the sour dough swells and the individual balls merge. The result is a cake the size of the pan, with individual pieces easily separated from the rest.
<H3>Bolke</H3>
The most widely used type of bread, both in the city and countryside, is not made at home, but in a bread factory or bakery. There are different types of or bakery. There are different types of  bolke, varying according to the type of flour (white, red wheat, or rye)  and form. Most common in Kazakhstan are the ‘‘brick’’ and the round ioaves.                                                                                                                          Baking bread is the aroma of childhood. Our moth ers made bolke with home-made yeast made from bindweed and cooked over a fire made from the wood of willow, caragana bush, shengelia, and reeds, To this day these smells leave our hearts longing for home. For each person these childhood smees are part of what the word ‘‘homeland’’ means.                                                                                 Today instead of saying, ‘‘Where there is bread, there is life,’’ it is often said, ‘‘There will be bread and there will also be a song.’’ May the forefather of all foods – holy bread – fill our dastarkhan in abundance for all ages.
