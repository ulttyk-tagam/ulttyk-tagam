<B>“Drinking tea helps to recover poise”  </B></FONT></P>
Tea got spread in our country comparatively recently – about three centuries ago. Meanwhile, it’s impossible to distinguish tea as allogenic in the range of Kazakh drinks, as far as it takes a place of honor among them. Perhaps, it`s explained by the fact that the sanative drink consists of tannin, amino acid, vitamins, essential oils and rich assortment of other healthful components. Nowadays, when there are lots of sorts of tea, and different preparation ways, it seems like there is no person or family who doesn’t drink this invigorant and aromatic drink. Tea is strongly implemented in our everyday life, apparently, because without it we suffer a headache.

This plant is also named “shaishobi” – tea herb. In Russian language it is called immortal or immortelle. In high-mountain regions shopshai blooms in July, and it`s double egg-shaped leaves of dun color and lilaceous inflorescences and put in a bag.

Dense texture is spread on the land, on which shopshai is spread out thickly, and covered with clean material, and then closed with thick felt, and pressure in wet condition, darken, and take black color. If it stays for a long time, a mold smell may appear. It`s important to take away the pressure and coverlet in time. Plants with material below are spread under the sun. When shopsai wholly dries up, dry inflorescences and leaves are decorticated, halms are chopped with little hatchet. Chopped halms are pushed in mortar by pestle, after that leaves and flowers are pounded in mortar and mixed all together. Sometimes dried leaves of peppermint are added for better smell. Shoshai is a sanative herb. During subacidity drink shopshai without milk. Also ashberry, flowers of tutsan and sunflower, decoction of raspberry and blackberry are added to shopshai and are useful for liver and kidney diseases.
