  This specialty was offered to honored guest from time immemorial. Zhent is made for special mass celebrations, such as national holidays, anniversaries, weddings.

In order to make zhent, which meets the idea of this product developed over the centuries, each component should be of a high quality, and their proportion should be up to traditionally established level.If the contect of a single ingredient is more or less than required, the perfect taste of the product will change.

Although there are a lot of natural reservoirs with a fish in Kazakh land, and recognizing its nutritive value, the Kazakhs never made fishing and cooking food with swimming “cattle” their craft. Fish was in favor only in lean year. But in some occasions they could cook it in various ways and eat it with pleasure like any other rare food. And as a rule our people gave names to anything and everything living and growing on the earth and in the water: animals and birds, insects and fish, threes and herbs.  How many fish is in the water, so many names. Suyrik – starlet, bekire – sturgeon, arkan balyk – eel, shokyr – stellate sturgeon, shortan – pike and sazan, akkairan – ide, mongke – crucian, kokserke – pike perch, zhaiyn – cat – fish, alabuga – perch and other. There is innumerable variety of fish, but a lot of names are forgotten forever.
