<h3>Uyiz </h3> 
Spring is the festival period for farmers because sheep gives a birth to lambs, cows gives a birth to calves, mares gives a birth to colts, and camels gives a birth to camels. Recently born females are milked and this colostrums is poured into a separate dish, called a kazan, with water and heated with fire. When the water boils, foremilk gets hard like liver. Colostrum may be poured into the refined thick intestine or small milk – churn and it is solidified by the same method. Only half of the first foremilk of animals is milked in order to leave the rest for the kids in order to get them to stand up on their legs as soon as possible, otherwise they become weak and are slowly bread. It’s from this that we know the saying, “wasn’t sated by colostrums.” Foremilk of mares and camels are given fully to their offspring.                    During this period the farmers increase their activities: they invite and give each other koten shek as the main refreshment.

This food is cooked in the pasture by herdsmen, who had no time to eat in the morning and who wouldn’t be available for dinner, then it is put into a small milk – churn, after which is buried in the hot coals of a burned out bonfire. After the milk comes to a boil, the cooked dish is taken from the coals and put on the grass, after that it is possible to take the pellicle off from the food and start eating the molozivo, which is very delicious.

This is cream made from fresh milk. In some regions it is called “damp kaimak.” This cream may be added to tea. Cream is gathered in a torsyk. When it sours it is whipped to make butter.

Buttermilk is poured into a large kazan and boiled for a long time. When it begins to thicken, reduce the heat and stir constantly. When the buttermilk finally thickens, pour it into a bag made of porous fabric. A whey that is formed may be rolled up into balls, pressed down, laid out on a mat, hung under a canopy, or put for drying.                                                                                                                                  Kurt, depending on the quality of the buttermilk, may be divided into asshy kurt, ezhigei kurt (sour kurt), cheese kurt, and katyk kurt made from sour milk.

This is the name for the insoluble residue from kurt, which resembles the shape of  alcha (wild cherry). These sour lumps are good to suck on, and children are very fond of them. Older people use it sometimes to curb their thirst or hunger. The proverb “kurt is now called malta” shows that this sour by-product has its own name and special purpose. 
<h3>Kurtka pisken sure       </h3>                                                                                                               
This dish is eaten with pleasure by people of all ages. It is a dried meat dipped in boiling kurt for about 30 minutes. Cooking dried meat in irimshik gives it a sweet taste, and cooking meat in kurt gives it a bit of a sour taste,. Interestingly, in both kurt and irimshik the dried meat keeps its smoky smell after cooking. After a long boil, it thickens and is mixed with butter and served to quests. It is believed that is good protection from such illnesses as a runny nose and cough. Fine kurt that has accumulated at the bottom of the bag may be mixed with sour cream or kaimak and fed to the elderly. If diluted kurt is added to it, kozhe that has been boiled in the water from any kind of grain is not inferior to kozhe that has been prepared in milk or broth.
<h3>Irimshik   </h3>                                                                                                                                 
This is one of the foods that is prepared for the annual winter stock. After their summer work in the pastures, a family of cattlemen gathering for the winter period will have six or seven bags of kurt-irimshik, three or four suzbe leather pitchers, five or six containers of butter, and even dairy products to generously offer their relatives. Sedentary farmers give them keusen, a few sacks of millet and wheat, as an offering from the first harvest. This is not an ordinary commodity exchange, as it might seem to an outsider, but a certain level of traditional Kazakh relationship that is a measure of closeness and mutual respect. Irimshik may be divided into two main types: ak (white) irimshik and kyzyl (red) irimshik.
<h3>Sarisu    </h3>

When boiling plenty of irimshik,remaining fluid is one or one and a half liters of thick sarisu, which has a reddish-brown color and tastes like candy “toffee” or chocolate. If the liquid is poured into a shallow bowl, within five or six hours, it solidifies. Cold mass is sliced and served as a dessert for tea. Before freezing sarisu some add raisins and crushed nuts.
<h3>Aqirim    </h3>                                                                                                                                      
As per written testimony, tea was not spread in Kazakh land until two or three centuries ago. We also know all the drinks to quench your thirst were made of milk. It is widely known kumis (mare’s milk), shubat, kymran iran, katyk, irkit, shalap as well as others. Among others there is another drink called aqirim. It is a broth, especially with dried meat, which is served together with airan, katyk or mare’s milk, well stirred with soup ladle. Aqirim is served hot and chilled, good as a thirst-quenching drink. Nutritious and healthy aqirim is both food and drink. What is more important it helps to digest food faster. 
<h3>Ak tushpara      </h3>

Nowadays cottage cheese is available at any store or at the bazaar, the technologoly is similar to making white irimshik, stuffed “dumplings” boiled in the water or steam cooked. Dumplings are not as rich and tasty as home*made ak tushpara.
<h3>Umash kozhe   </h3>

<h3>Kuymak        </h3>

Mix two cups of flour, three eggs, half a cup of water, a cup of milk, one tablespoon of sugar, adding a little salt, knead the dough and leave until it rises. If kuymak prepared with unleavened dough, take the same quantity of  flour to knead dough, adding ten eggs, two cups of milk, two tablespoons of butter and salt. Heat frying pan and grease it with vegetable oil (traditionally used chicken wing), pour a spoon of batter and fry both sides. Served  with sour cream or butter.
<h3>Kumis    </h3>                                                                                                                                    
Universal healthy drink, made of fermented mare’s milk. Kumis in fact kept the Kazakhs alive during all these centuries. This drink, if just fermented, can make you drunk, quenches thirst, fills the stomach, makes you sweat, and if you traveled a long way kumis makes you sleep. Abundance of kumis is a sign of satiety and satisfaction.                                                                                                                             Our people have perfected the art of making kumis during many centuries. As a result, there is a distinction between qualitative characteristics of ready-to drink kumis depending on the age of the mare, the time of year when it was made; period of fermentation; taste and caloric content of the product. Each type of kumis was given a name, and had a special meaning for the traditions and rituals, customs, omens and signs.
<h3>Shubat   </h3>                                                                                                                                         
This  drink is sacred and respected by the Kazakhs, just like kumis. It is made of camel’s milk only. Shubat making is a little easier compared to kumis. In addition, shubat making was developed more in the west, while camel breeding was more or less developed in all regions of the bondless Kazakh steppe. In some places tea was served with thick and fat camel milk. Irimshik and kurt was made of camel milk mixed with cow and sheep milk.                                                                                             Shubat is fermented in torsuk made of camel’s neck skin. Camel milk is poured into torsyk with ferment – so called kor for shubat – and left for two days. Shubat is not mixed up constantly like kumis, it is poured into a dish, milk skin is removed and shaken up with a little whisk. Dish for shubat – torsyk and kubi should be washed and dried up frequently. In some places shubat is alled “kymyran”.
