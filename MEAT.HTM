<h3>KAZY</h3>
Kazy is a delicacy which is made of horse’s rids with meat and adipose tissue in the shell of horse intestine. Adipose tissue provides high energetic values and gives it nice flavor. Kazi measured by the layer of fat: alabult kazi (insignificant layer of fat), shintak kazi, barmak kazi, eki eli, ush eli tort eli, the fattest-taban (same with palm). If adipose tissue is grown so, that the kazy does not fit in the gut, they make dongbek kazy, which is stored without shell.                                                            For kazy twelve pair of ribs are used, they are cut from the each half of the chest without violating the integrity of the bones (by joints). These ribs are from sixth to seventeenth, which are separated from the spine and cartilage is removed. For kazy each rid is separated with muscle and adipose tissue, for kos kazy (double kazy) separate pairs: sixth with seventh, eight with ninth and so on.                                                    On each rid or each pair of rids from the inside the cartilage and trimmed intercostal tissue are removed, from the junction point of the rids with the spine, to the point of linking them to the cartilage. For kos kazy, an incision is made so that the paired fins were connected by muscle tissue. Prepare mixture from salt, black and sweet pepper, garlic. And then kazy is sprinkled with a mixture and withstood a day. In advance bowel s sprinkled with salt and left soaking for few hours. Ready horse rids are attached to intestinal membrane, the ends of the intestines are bandaged, the arch shape and hung for curing or smoking is given. While cooking kazy increases in volume, especially if they are from the meat of a young animal. When there is a shortage of horse intestine beef intestines can be used as shells for kazy.                                                                                                                                    Kazy is boiled in a large cookware, the foam is removed and kept boiling on a low heat. Sometimes kazy is cooked in gauze, so that the shell didn’t burst. Kazi is the most honorable and valuable type of food and decorate any dastsrkhan, any ritual dish. Therefore, one or two pieces of kazi are put in any dish.

<h3>ZHAL-ZHAYA</h3>
Zhaya  
This is a delicacy prepared from horse meat and served with a layer of horse fat on top. Zhaya has a unique taste and contains equal layers of meat and fat. Zhaya has fresh, dry, and smoked forms, and is made from a specific cut of horse including the back of the sacral and the front part of the tail vertebrae. The sacral bones are removed, leaving only two or three vertebrae. The pieces are then salted with a mixture made from salt and black pepper. The salted meat is left for two three days and hung up for drying or smoking. Boiled zhaya may be served as an hors-d’oeuvre.
Zhal 
The name of this horse fat dish originally comes from the word “zhal,” which means “mane.” Zhal includes fat from the wither and rump, the most valuable part of horse meat, and is considered to be a highly nutritional delicacy. The fatty layer runs from the withers to the first vertebrae of the neck. The withers have more fat than the neck, and as it descends to the lower quarters the fat disappears. Zhal is made by cutting out from the first vertebra of the neck to the second or third vertebra of the chest. Zhal is pickled with a mixture of salt and pepper, and then left for one day. After pickling, the zhal may be boiled or smoked.                                                       Zhal from fatty tissues is reserved as a ceremonial food for honoured guests. Horse experts define a well fed horse not by the form of its hooves, but by the fat on its mane. People say that a fat horse’s zhal rises over its ears.                                                      In remote places where there is no refrigeration, zhal is cut in multiple places and salted or covered in salt water. It is then smoked for two to three hours with juniper wood and hung to dry. In modern times, zhal is served as an hors-d’oeuvre with kazy and karta.

<h3>KUIRDAK</h3>
Roasted meat by Kazakh takes the second place among hot dishes by the importance after meat in Kazakh way. After carving large or small cattle while the meat is cooked, hosts give kuyrdak with tea. Especially often kuyrdak is prepared in the period of cattle carving for winter. Autumn carving is a supply for autumn, sogym is winter stock preparation of which is accompanied by the rituals connected with many national traditions. As the proved “The best kuyrdak is cooked when camel is carved!”, so by old tradition, in autumn and winter in the period of cattle carving, it is possible to taste kinds of this dish, prepared under different recipes and technologies.                                                                                               Butchers cutting the carcass can separate necessary meat products for kuyrdak and give them to carvers. First of all, the meat cut off from neck, which is taken entirely or half depending on quantity of eaters, is used for kuyrdak. The meat scraps which remained at cutting the carcass and heart are added to it. Meat and heart are cut into small pieces and washed out well to exsanguinations.                                  Inside fat cut in advance is fried thoroughly in kazan, then the lungs cut by cubes are added, and then added meat and heart, salted to taste and frying is continued. After a while, when kuyrdak is almost ready and exudes a smell of the kept meat, cut liver is put: it is a product of fast preparation. Even at surplus of fat in kazan pour one-two scoops of hot water so that kuyrdak does not burn slightly and reached on a steam.A cover of kazan is densely covered and left on weak fire to full readiness. Before giving on a table add crumbled onions or greens of mountain onions. Kuyrdak laid out on a dish is decorated with onions cut in circles. Red and black pepper is added separately for taste.

<h3>Tostik kaktau</h3>   
This method is so-called frying of breast-bone with fat and abdomen. Hunters, who could catch an animal, firstly remove its skin, and then carve it into pieces. Primarily, the innards of animal should be put out; next a breast-bone and abdomen are cut. At the beginning wool is singed in the fire and its soot has to be cleaned. Then the breast-bone is pulled on the strut made from wooden sticks and cooked over charcoal adding salt. When the fat melts and drops on the coals, flame fire is flaring. You need to sprinkle water in order to prevent breast-bone burnt and thick layer of meat half-baked. Tostik is hiking food, which should be cooked and eaten outdoors, or in the yard.
<h3>Kuykalak   </h3>                                                                                                                                       
This dish is also prepared from hunting prey. Having felt hungry while tracking down and chasing the game, in order to stifle hunger, hunters try to have a bite before skinning and butchering carcasses. They kindle a fire, while removing animal insides, then colon, kidney, spleen and liver are sprinkled by salt and buried in hot ashes. Kuykalak is baked quicker than tostik. Cool should be disposed, afterwards dish is ready for eating.                                                                                    No one could suppose kuykalak and tostik are eaten only by hunters. These dishes are prepared along with slaughter of sheep and goats. Although these dishes firstly appeared in hunting life, but the story about meat dishes should begin with the simplest ways of cooking meals.                                                                                      Zhaubuyrek                                                                                                                           For cooking this meal you also do not need any tableware. Once the sheep is slaughtered and shared the carcass, fat is cut off from the fatty tail and sliced into big pieces. Liver is cut in the same manner, insensibly adding salt. The mixed pieces of fat and liver are hanged on a skewer and broiled as kyauap or shashlik. It is important to make sure that the flame does not reach pieces of fatty tail and liver. Anyone can have this dish, seasoning with onion or pepper , or with sauce, cooked by adding spices. It depends on the tastes. Zhaubuyrek is cooked in the same manner, alternating pieces of kidney, spleen and sheep fat on the skewer.                         Zhauzhumyr                                                                                                                       This is one of the best methods of cooking meat without tableware. It was invented by Kazakh men, who have to spend their life mostly in solitude.                                    This widely used method of cooking meat without tableware for the most part was used during the long way road of hunting, enemy attack, during barymty which means cattle stealing. After butchering carcasses of small domestic animals or goats and deers, their dismembered parts fully fit in their well-washed stomachs – karyn. According to the tastes, into dismembered pieces should be added salt, wild onion and little water. An outlet tube which is made from the leg of animal is inserted into beast’s stomach in order to exit steam and also it should be tightly tied up to make it stable. For baking a deep and large hole is dug in advance from 5 to 6 bayonets, where hunters make fire and heat it to a high pitch. When the fire burns, large coals are replaced by karyn that is filled full of meat. The free end of outlet tube is put outside the hole, and the hole with karyn inside is firstly covered by hot coals, and then by the layer of earth which thickness should be 3-4 fingers. Over these layers hunters kindle the fire again, and thereafter go about their business until full preparation of dish. Will they back in a day or two, whenever there would be the treasure of prepared delicate and fragrant meat.                                                      Tute                                                                                                                                    I remembered the recipe the writer told me on that evening. It was evidently coined during the predatory raids and disturbances, assault and military conquest. Tute is prepared from any meat that is salted, and then dried in a hanged way. When dried meat has hardened, it is cut on small pieces with an ax. Sliced meat is put in a special cookware and hammered it until it would turn into tiny pieces called “tute-tute”. As you can see, this expression is being survived until now. When the soldiers feel hunger riding horses and camels during all day and night they eat tute out of their korzhun. This was one type of the food which was unfortunately forgotten through many years.          
<h3>Burme       </h3>                                                                                                                        
Citizens of cold winter regions use this method of meat storage. When attacking of the first cold, small livestock is slaughtered in order not to waste supplies of hay and fodder and not to allow to the cattle loose weight during the winter. Carcass is slaughtered, salted and laid in their own bladders, tied and placed in a shoshala. In its own sauce meat is better impregnated with salt and stored until spring. One more type of burme is – to store meat with scorched, cleaned and washed head and legs, with thoroughly washed and treated viscera in the skin of slaughtered animal. If during the winter comes honored guest, without further ado they get ready supplies and put them in a cauldron. Over the centuries in different seasons and in different climatic conditions our people have evolved different methods of storage of food stocks. At the same time provided qualified treatment of product, which did not loose nutritional value and taste. For example, meat which is put in burme, shouldn’t be too salty, otherwise sorpa won’t be edible. If this happened, then when cauldron boiled Kazakh took two or three pieces of charcoal (spruce), wrapped it in gauze and dipped in a cauldron in order to sorbent absorb salt.                       
<h3>Karta    </h3>                                                                                                                                   
This dish is a delicacy that is equal with kazy as a source of nourishment and ceremonial importance. This dish is prepared from the intestine and fatty sections of a well-fed horse. The intestines are removed, turned inside out, and washed in cold water. The karta is placed in a pickling mixture made from salt, black pepper and garlic and left for two to three days. After pickling, the karta is washed in cold water and tied at both ends, twisted, and dried out. Sometimes karta may be smoked. Karta can be served as an hors-d’ oeuvre with kazy, or added to the Kazakh dish called bishbarmak.    
<h3>Shuzhyk        </h3>                                                                                                                    
When sogym(winter meat) is cut, all the secondary parts and the leftover fat are combined into one dish. After the sogym is cut, salt, pepper, garlic, and onion are mixed in and everything is stuffed into the intestine. Shuzhyk is then hung up for drying or smoking. Dried or smoked shuzhyk may be kept for a long time.                                 Shuzhyk may be prepared from beef, but dried shuzhuk from horse meat is distinguishable from the other types. Shuzhyk – which, like kazy, may be kept in flour or dried – produces a nice smell when cut or boiled. It tastes delicious and is easy to digest. Shuzhyk is a national food that is prepared for honored guests.
<h3>Buzhy       </h3>                                                                                                                               
After cutting the meat, heart, liver, and fat, add salt, onion, carrot, pepper, and other spices, then stuff the fourth stomach with the mixture and place it in water. Tie or sew up the buzhy and boil it in a kazan. Although buzhy is heated and cooked in the stomach with its own sauce, buzhy can lose its smell, tenderness, and taste.
<h3>Asip </h3>
This is Kazakh sausage prepared from fat and meat stuffed into an intestine and boiled in a kazan. A section of lamb is cut, along with the fat, heart, and liver. Rice, onion, salt, and pepper are added and mixed well with water. The lamb intestines are removed, washed, stuffed with the mixture, and closed up. The intestine should not be stuffed too tightly, as the rice will expand. Make a few small holes in the intestine and put it into salt water or broth to boil for about one hour. It is served, either hot or cold, in the form of a circle.                                                      
<h3>Borsha   </h3>                                                                                                                              
This is a kind of kebab. Borsha is made from the fleshy part of a fat cow that is cut into pieces, seasoned with salt and pepper, and cooked on a grill until it is done to taste. The word borsha refers to different lengths, cuts, and thicknesses of meat. This dish is called borsha because all the meat is cut into slices. Borsha is especially good when served with kumis on a picnic with friends. The smell of borsha will spread and might attract a crowd.           
<h3>Ultabar         </h3>                                                                                                                                   
In Russian it is mutton stomach or better to say only a part of small cattle. However, thoroughly washed up and cleaned, it sometimes becomes a part of the carcass as one of necessary elements of an honorable dish for the daughter-in-law, playing the ceremonial role. After careful processing the stomach is turned out and filled with crumbly inside fat of the castrated goat salted and seasoned with black pepper. The person, cutting meat for a dish of daughter-in-law or a usual dish where stomach is put, cuts off its tip and according to a ceremony, gives to one of daughters-in-law.                                                                                                                           “The daughter will not leave you without care, and with son your fireplace will never die” – Kazakh people say, because sons take a special place in human life, they support fire of the family centre. By the way, otagasy (from agasy) “the elder brother of fire” through this word in means “the father of family” is used in literally translation. The sons are hoped not to be simply otagasy – fathers of family, but also protection and support for the people. This gesture of meat carver is full of masked sense goes from beliefs that observance of this ceremony will lead to a birth of the boy.        
<h3>Karakuyardak     </h3>                                                                                                                           
In translation the dish is named in Russian «black kuyrdak». Obviously, this kind of kuyrdak is named so because roasted liver gets very dark color. This kuyrdak is prepared from liver and lung with addition of small amount of meat. All is cut into very small pieces. For liver not to harden, put it when the dish is almost ready.
<h3>Zhonka kuyrdak </h3>                                                                                                                                      
It is translated as “kuyrdak from stroganina” i.e meat cut in chips. When it is not season for cattle carving, and fresh meat is not available, kuyrdak should be fried only from pure meat without addition of offal: lung, liver, hem and guts. Mostly people do it of the frozen meat which is cut in chips with an axe in the form of sticks. Put onions, salt kuyrdak, sometimes there is some potato, rice or pasta. 
<h3>Dirildek         </h3>                                                                                                                             
A dish from entrails, similar to jellied meat. This kind of food is prepared when a cow is carved on sogym before the winter period. When a head and feet is cooked, the broth which has remained after cooking becomes jelly next morning. Probably, therefore the idea to use this feature of broth for creating a dish unknown to old ancestors has arisen. Now it has the right to take the place on our dastarkhan as well as ancient dishes. First of all cow’s feet, are singed, then carefully cleaned and washed out. Ankle bones are put in capacious ware together with the bottom of half  beam both elbow bones and a bone of a wrist of beam bones and the bottom of third hip bones, and also bones of skipping joint, all meat preliminary having cut off from them. Also unsuitable for preparation of ceremonial dishes nasal part of a head is used for dirildek. Fill in with water, lead up to boiling and cook for a long time on a slow fire. To give to this dish special taste, add back part of one-two hens, and sometimes even chicken meat. When soft skin departs from bones, contents of kazan is taken out from broth and left to be cooled, then take off all bones, a skeleton of hen, black skin covering of nasal part together with grits. Boiled products are cut into pieces and passed through a meat grinder.                                       Broth is filtered through a strainer or gauze, products passed through a meat grinder and entirely two-three onions, two-three carrots, five-six garlic are added. Before pouring in forms or plates, vegetables prepared for dirildek are taken out. Allow mixes to boil, add salt, put on slow fire and constantly stir so that not to be burnt. When the volume will start to be reduced, add small cut onions, garlic, black and red pepper, if necessary, add some salt to taste, mix well and spill in special forms or plates. The remains can be poured in deep ware for long storage in a refrigerator where the dish does not lose the flavor and nutritious quality. Serving dirildek it is possible to cut it as squares or to decorate with onions and greens.  Now city dwellers prepare dirildek for celebratory dastarkhan, without waiting sogym as all necessary products for it can be got at any time of the years on a market.
