<h3>AKTALGAN TARY</h3>
Aktalgan  tary is bleached millet. The people, inbabiting Central Asia and Kazakhstan for centuries, engaged in the elaboration of millet, boiled, fried, pummeling the grain in a wooden mortar, cleaning of the seminal films, i.e. consume it in food only in the bleached state. Millet, bleached in the raw form  is called “sok tary”, while in other regions the processing in the boiled or roasted way millet is also called “sok”. As usual in most parts of the tradition, we will call processed in boiled or fried form bleached millet, and in raw form sok tary. Sok tary  refined by industrially produced method of raw millet. Its taste cannot be compared to bleached millet. The sok tary, bleached raw millet was particularly in demand, but in the past two centuries, the demand for millet and buckwheat sok greatly increased due to the development of technological production.                                  An interesting fact is that during the refinery of millet by the Kazakh technology, ratio comprising millet components such as protein, starch, fat, sugar had undergone significant changes, their flavor and aromatic properties were improved. Perhaps this was due to the fact that the grain is cooked and fried in the shell. Bleached millet is a fine product, from which you can cook many different dishes.So, while millet is treated and dumped in bags, there are a lot of work put in it. The high  yield of millet was in the virgin lands and black soil, even in the droughtiest year, which makes it very valuable insurance culture. It is a short- day plant, so the faster ripening was in late summer. This biological feature of millet can get two crops per year. In cultivars with a spreading panicle brush is heavier and oppress another stem. When the corn reaches the milk maturity, it should be protected from theft. “In my field the millet rises like wall, accursed flocks of sparrows flock to it” – the farmers complain. This time in the field children come with drums, rattles, whistles, slingshots and slings, guard the harvest. Ripe millet is harvested with sickles and tops. Until now, those who like tary do not allow container harvest their small crops of millet with combine. When the machine threshed grain, some of millet loses its shell. When that millet is cooking, it will be only “kara kozhe”. Grain loses quality and its golden color. Ventilated and dry panicles of millet trample underfoot, ground by wooden club, mortar or pestle, when there are a large number they stroll on a grain once or twice by a stone roller, which is shantas. Grain winnowed, well dried, poured into bags and stored in a dry place or barn. “What gets in the barn, does not always fall into the bag, and if they fall into the bag,  can not get into the cauldron" – as the saying goes. This means that the hardest work still lies ahead.                                                                                                                          Millet is put to boil in a large kettle, then two or three times washed, after that spread on the mat to let water flow down. If trends millet cleared of trash, then during the washing removes small stones and dust. There was some measure of millet in the eye that is boiled in a cauldron over a low heat. When you cook you want to monitor that millet not to seethe. From time to time you have to remove the strainer with a pinch of millet and taste, whether it is ready. If it boiled, almost all of the husks of millet grains will e revealed, and you get the kara koje. It is impossible to make a quality product from over boiled millet. Also during frying exposed side of grain foothills will also affect not only the quality but also the finished product. An undercooked thresh millet is hard to clean with husks. Well-cooked grains of millet again throws on the mat so that the hot water runs out, then poured over the top with cold water for washing.                                                                   After all of these procedures, proceed to the process of frying. Millet is fried by portions on a quick heat. It will be better to take a long mixer, which easily reaches the bottom and walls of the cauldron, to constantly stir the millet. Stirring is a necessary condition for uniform cooking. Good fried millet has a dark golden color and produces an appetizing smell. At this stage it is recommended to try corn on the tooth.Pounding millet in a mortar – is, of course, very difficult. One bucket of grain pounded in portions of 6-7 techniques. Keli – stupa is covered with tight lid with a hole diameter handle pesto and begin to crumble. When 75-80% of grain husk, millet shifted into a flat dish or shallow bowl and winnowed. This is called roughing. Then proceed to retreatment, i.e. bleaching. Wastes from this procedure is called “tary talkany” – talkan millet. Usually it mixed with millet for good tasting. In that case, when it is not mixed, Talkan is sifted through a sieve and used as a tasty and useful supplement to milk for baby food.The fact is that the bleaching of millet is the most time-consuming and arduous process, as outlined above. Therefore, it involves not only women and children, but also men. In former times, the cultivation of millet, its formulation, by tradition, engaged together several families from one village. In that case, if cooking tary is not involved, the participants of Asar – beat all the cauldrons, mortar and pestle collected in the same house. On this day, they slaughter the sheep, and if they have no sources, they put in a cauldron what they have, and begin with jokes and complete work with jokes too. If someone of experienced and knowledgeable grandmothers cooks millet, and some fries, then the strong horsemen and young kelin (daughter-in-law) pound each in its mortar. This is exactly like the conveyor. Only recently millet was switch grass in panicles, and then you can see-already bleached and ready for use. The aroma of the finished tary is carried on the whoe district of freshly made millet. The bleached tary is not softened and did not lose a pleasant smell, it is stored in a dry place in a wooden dish or a leather bag. You can use glass packaging for this purpose.Now producers of millet do not have a dedicated staff, which would reap tops of cereal, as expected, threshing done manually using clappers and the rink with a millstone, and finally processed to millet in a mortar pestle. As noted above, the harvesting of grain by harvesters, millet loses its shell, and here is one possible solution: machine operators must adjust drum threshing to specific grains such as millet. Clubs, hand rollers, mortars with a pestle now difficult to find, they can be seen in a museum. But we can not forget the Kazakh-made tary.

<h3>TARY KOZHE</h3>
Kozhe with tary cooked in a broth. Tary should be added in broth with finely minced meat and cooked until it will be a done. Before serving it, you can add sliced onions and healthy dish is the kind of diet food. Boiled millet in combination with meat is possible to gastric diseases.                                                              Tary can also be eaten in well soaked form in fat broth. On the surface of boiling broth in which meat is cooked, the fat is removed, washed tary is poured, then you can mix and cover it with lid and place to languish until the swelling grain. As the saying goes: “Eat only a handful of dry tary, and in your stomach it will be like a five handfuls”, so the volume of tary after the swelling increases several time s, so for the preparation of tary in fat it will be better to use a large bowl. This dish is called “May bokpen”.                                                                                                                  Tary, with its unique taste is good in any way, and everyone who tasted it, would not say that he did not like the food, because our people for centuries honored the art of cooking this valuable product.
<h3>Roasted Barley and Wheat </h3>                                                                                                                
The existence of so many grain related sayings makes it obvious that of previous generations knew the value of grain:                                                                                     If barley fills you up                                                                                                               
Your meal is blessed.                                                                                                              The meat of a firstborn lamb                                                                                             Would gladly be given for barley.                                                                                         The Kazakh language is full of a wide variety of vocabulary for different types of wheat and millet: ak bidai – white wheat, kojabas bidai – large-grained wheat, kara bidai – rye, kizil bidai – red wheat, and similarly  ak tari – white millet, kizil tari – red millet, kara tari – black millet, and zhabayi konak  - wild guest’ millet. It is obvious that the names of these crops can be traced to ancient times.                                 Of course our ancestors did not have plows for plowing the soil, tractors for processing and seeding, combines for harvesting, or other agricultural machinery. The land was plowed with a wooden plow, seeds were sown by hand, grain was reaped with a sickle or scythe and threshed using wooden hammers. The production of grain, one of the basic food groups, relieved the people’s complete dependence on dairy and meat products. Grain stocks and seed were stored in brick-lined pits or in leather bags.                                                                                           Before cooking, roasted barley and wheat were washed in water to clean out any impurities. Through washing, small stones settled to the bottom and dirt would rise to the top. As the barley and wheat were drying, the damp grain was poured into a wooden mortar where it was lightly tapped with a wooden pestle to remove the chaff. Archaeologists have discovered that before the intention of the wooden mortar and pestle, chaff was removed from the grain a hollow stone, kiln-dried clay, and the skin of a large animal. The refined grain was winnowed to remove the chaff and roasted in a kettle over a low flame. In ordre to roast the grain evenly, it was stirred the entire time with a wooden spatula. When it reached a reddish-brown hue, it was fried. Kazakhs call a red, sunburned face a ‘‘wheat tan.’’                           The fried grain was again poured into a mortar and gently peeled, then winnowed again. The cereal was then ready to eat and could be poured into a cup of tea, mixed with butter, or poured into hot milk. From this nourishing food came the saying, ‘‘If you eat just one grain, it will give you strength to go as far as you can see.’’                                                                                                                                          To prepare a dish called bokpen, barley and wheat are refried in butter. It is believed that bokpen protects against eye diseases and improves vision.                                   Talkan is obtained by crushing roasted barley or wheat in a mortar. Wheat talkan can be added to milk, to sorpa (broth), to tea or mixed with butter. During difficult times, talkan can take the place of many other dishes for our people. When it is said of man ‘‘His talkan is finished,’’ it refers to his death, the painful truth of the ages.                                                                                                                                 From talkan and wheat, cooked with milk and butter, comes a thin porridge called bilamik. Many different types of   bilamik are prepared from different types of grains. A thick porridge with sugar and fruit, called top, is often prepared for the elderly. Rice, bleached millet, and other grains are boiled in salt water, with cream or butter added. This delicious and healthy food is appropriate for people of all ages, but especially for children.                                                                                   
<h3>Bidai kozhe    </h3>                                                                                                             
Kozhe is a liquid dish that is prepared from different types of cereals. The grain is cleaned of its flack and other impurities and crushed in a keli (mortar). A small amount of water is stirred into the crushed wheat. The resulting mixture is spread into the mortar and pounded until the wheat is completely crushed and takes on the consistency of dough. This process of preparing kozhe is called zhanshu, which means ‘‘flattening.’’ In the process of flatting, the mixture is frequently stirred. When different types of grain are mixed in equal portions, the result is another dish – byrt kozhe. Pressed grains are boiled in either milk, diluted by water, meat broth, or water. The kozhe is brought to a simmer over a low heat, without allowing a strong boil. In order to keep it from sticking to the bottom, the kozhe must be stirred constantly. As it begins to thicken, the fire is extinguished, the lid placed on the kettle, and the kozhe allowed to cool. After an hour, the kozhe is checked for taste and then brought again to a boil. Kozhe is prepared with broth or milk and is served hot. Kozhe in water needs to have kozhe-katyk – an additive made from thick airan. The kozhe is cooled and mixed together with kurt and suzbe kattyk, a thick paste made of airan. This tart, cool drink is good on a hot day, quenching both thirst and hunger. Bidai kozhe is a nourishing and delicious food and drink.                                                                                                               

<h3>Susindik kozhe    </h3>                                                                                                           
This sour kozhe, also called ashigan kozhe, is for drinking. This dish is prepared by boiling in water the kozhe of various grains; wheat, barley, millet, corn, buckwheat, or rice. It uses the zhanshu method.                                                                 Kozhe that is to be fermented is not salted. It is intended to quench one’s thirst and should not be thick. However, sometimes in the process of cooking, a little flour is added to thicken it a bit. If it thickens too much it can be thinned with boiled water. Susyndyk kozhe can be seasoned with ayran, fermented milk, mare’s milk, cottage cheese, or dissolved kurt. Fermented kozhe is poured into a saba – a big bag made of smoked horse leather used for keeping kumis .Kozhe may be stored in enemal pots, but should not be kept in dishes made of aluminum or other metal, as these spoil the taste of the food.                                                                                                                       In the past, shepherds and other field workers carried with them burdyuk and torsyk full of kozhe. They kept it out of the sun, either in water or buried underground, to keep it from spoiling while they worked. The cool drink refreshed them, easing both hunger and thirst.                                                                                                          Today many private entrepreneurs sell iced susyndyk kozhe  at markets and train and bus stations. However, they are not able to ensure appropriate sanitary conditions.
<h3>Tary            </h3>                                                                                                                                    
Switch grass is one of the most valuable species of grasses and is very honorable in the hierarchy of Kazakh food. It owns original methods of processing for a wide range of cooking dishes such as liquid, and solid. No doubt setaria and mogaria which grew in the endless steppes due the man, became the ancestors of the millet, as well as couch grass became the ancestor of the wheat.                                                 The people who composed the sayings: ‘‘Millet is a source of satiety’’, ‘‘who has the millet, he asks nothing’’, experienced many trials and lost the sedentary life, still they never forgot to sow millet, leaving farmers with fields in the lodges, indoor koshma. Even in Soviet times, in time of the cultivation of millet there was a period of great expansion. If each region planted famous Kazakh varieties of red and black millet, they became famous. For example Shyganak ata from Aktyube became famous throughout the world that sowed ‘‘white millet from Oyilsk’’.
<h3>Suzbe tary    </h3>                                                                                                                              
Fot this dish you need to prepare fresh suzbe, which is ayran poured into a porous cloth bag and hung to 1-2 hours. Thickened suzbe hard for salt and add to it a 1:1 ratio, i.e. one by one, tary (because, unlike sok tary it is better to call bleached tary, as all recipes are connected with it). The mixture is stirred thoroughly, then shifted into carefully cleaned and washed, turned inside out and dried in inflated sheep stomash-karyn. To remove the remnants of the mixture of whey, karyn is pierced in several places with a needle and left to dry in the shade. When serum is spilled, and the volume of karyn halved, it is possible to put the remaining mixture, then let the liquid drain. The mixture dries, while the contents harden, and the surface of karyn became salt. Ready suzbe-tary in karyn is stored for the winter, along with kurt and butter supplies. In winter days many people split off a piece of suzbe-tary, pour hot boiling water and cover the lid or towel. When millet becomes soft, the kozhe is ready fîr use.
<h3>Mai tary      </h3>                                                                                                                                            
Tary is mixed with butter, put for 2-3 hours to soften the grain, and it gets yhen easy to chew, especially for elderly. Tary is served to dastarkhan with cream or kaimak – foam from the milk. “If there’s a millet, there will be something to eat”, they say, and the Kazakhs in the long journey always took with them a bag with a supply of tary in a dry form. During migrations, arranging a halt, the Kazakhs pour tary into kese with tea to drink and eat hearty, and enjoy a tasty smell. Tradition to pour tary in tea for the good smelling has not been spread to some regions.
<h3>Tary botka   </h3>                                                                                                                                              
Tary botka is a porridge form of tary. In some places it is called “tary bortpe” or swollen tary. Enticing smell of the tary when it is mixed with hot milk, calls for a strong appetite. Porridge with tary is cooked over low heat. Do not allow milk to escape. Two or three liters of undiluted milk is required for two or three cups of tary. You can add tary in boiling milk, after two-three minutes remove from heat, leave it for two or three hours. When serving, sprinkle with sugar, out a piece of butter.
<h3>Tary – shuzhuk      </h3>                                                                                                                      
Pound of fat lamb chopped finely and then they add two or three sliced onions. In the cooked mixture a little black pepper is added, sprinkled with salt, then put the tary weighing less than half the meat. You can put crushed grain of tary. The mixture is stirred and stuffed into intestine, which ends are tightly tied. You should pierce intestine in one or two places with a fork, cook for two or two and a half hours. Tary – shuzhuk can be eaten in a hot or chilled form.
<h3>Maisok           </h3>                                                                                                                                                       
Kurduk fat of sheep is heated in the pan, not pouring out fat, then poured it on top by tary, which can be replaced by kunak and continued frying. Fried dish can be eaten in hot form or taken for the short term traveling. 
<h3>Sut kozhe    </h3>                                                                                                                                        
In other word it means milk kozhe. You must mix water and milk in equal parts, add salt, one or two cups of tary and put it on a slow fire. It should be boiled a couple of hours. The cover of the cauldron should be closed to give a porridge “relax”. During this time the grain is fully inflates, it becomes soft. Milk kozhe can be heated again, then the butter is added. Sut kozhe can be prepared not only from tary, but also from wheat and rice grains.   
<h3>Ashigan sut kozhe    </h3>                                                                                                                                  
Fermented sut kozhe. This kozhe is different from sut kozhe that it has more share of  water, but milk and tary – less, also salt is put very little or do without it. Kozhe boils up as long as the tary does not seethe completely, then it is colled. When kozhe a little warm, you can add a liter of put a piece of black bread yeast. After that kozhe is tightly wrapped and put in a warm place. After 10-11 hours kozhe comes to readiness, i.e. it will be sour. If kozhe is prepared properly, it will be a good kind of soft drink. Finished kozhe is stored in a wooden kuby or torsuk. Thickened kozhe is mixed with boiled water, ayran or fermented milk. The easiest way to cooking – not to allow depleted stocks, and top up in a bowl, where in the bottom there is a little fermented kozhe, just prepared.  
<h3>Tary kozhe cooked with sorpa    </h3>
